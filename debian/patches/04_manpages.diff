+
+
+SYNOPSIS
+--------
+*clfswm* ['implementation']
+
+
+DESCRIPTION
+-----------
+*clfswm* is a 100% Common Lisp X11 window manager (based on Tinywm and
+Stumpwm. Many thanks to them).  It can be driven only with the
+keyboard or with the mouse.
+
+*clfswm* uses the following rules to determine which implementation
+should be used:
+
+. the first command line argument.
+. environment variable $LISP
+. the first line like "debian=<impl>" in its configuration file.
+. clisp
+
+*clfswm* handles clisp, sbcl and cmucl internally.  If you specify a
+different implementation, clfswm will try to execute the command
+`clfswm-<implementation>`.  See /usr/share/doc/clfswm/README.Debian
+for details.
